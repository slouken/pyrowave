// Metal decoder for PyroWave, targeting Apple Silicon (Apple7 GPU family and up)
// on macOS and iOS. This is a decode-only API; encoding remains on the Vulkan side.
//
// This is the Metal counterpart to pyrowave.h and deliberately mirrors its naming.
// The two are alternative backends and are never linked into the same binary, so
// they share type and entry point names rather than disambiguating them.
//
// Metal objects cross the ABI as void *. This keeps the header usable from plain C,
// Objective-C and C++ alike, and sidesteps ARC ownership ambiguity at the boundary:
//   - Objective-C / ARC: pass (__bridge void *)mtlObject
//   - Objective-C, no ARC, or plain C: pass the object pointer directly
// Unless stated otherwise, objects passed in are retained for as long as PyroWave
// needs them and released on destroy, so the caller may release its own reference.
